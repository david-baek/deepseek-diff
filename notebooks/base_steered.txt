Solve the system: x + y = 5 and x^2 + y^2 = 13. Determine the possible values for x and y, and explain your reasoning.
Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

We have two equations:
1. \( x + y = 5 \)
2. \( x^2 + y^2 = 13 \)

First, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) from the first equation:
\[ y = 5 - x \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( y \) into the second equation:
\[ x^2 + (5 - x)^2 = 13 \]

Now we simplify and solve for \( x \):
\[ x^2 + (25 - 10x + x^2) = 13 \]
\[ 2x^2 - 10x + 25 = 13 \]
\[ 2x^2 - 10x + 12 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \]

This quadratic equation can be factored as:
\[ (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \]

So, the solutions for \( x \) are:
\[ x = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3 \]

Now we can find the corresponding values of \( y \) using \( y = 5 - x \):
- If \( x = 2 \), then \( y = 5 - 2 = 3 \).
- If \( x = 3 \), then \( y = 5 - 3 = 2 \).

Thus, the possible solutions for \((x, y)\) are \((2, 3)\) and \((3, 2)\).

Let's verify these solutions by substituting them back into the original equations. We'll use Python to ensure the calculations are accurate.

First, we'll verify the solution \((2, 3)\):
1. \( x + y = 2 + 3 = 5 \) (satisfied)
2. \( x^2 + y^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13 \) (satisfied)

Next, we'll verify the solution \((3, 2)\):
1. \( x + y = 3 + 2 = 5 \) (satisfied)
2. \( x^2 + y^2 = 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 13 \) (satisfied)

Both solutions satisfy the original equations. Therefore, the possible values for \( x \) and \( y \) are \((2, 3)\) and \((3, 2)\).

Finally, let's print the solution using Python.
```python
# Define the solutions
solutions = [(2, 3), (3, 2)]

# Verify the solutions by substituting them back into the original equations
def verify_solution(x, y):
    return (x + y == 5) and (x**2 + y**2 == 13)

# Verify each solution
verified_solutions = [sol for sol in solutions if verify_solution(*sol)]

print(verified_solutions)
```
```output
[(2, 3), (3, 2)]
```
The verified solutions for the system of equations \(x + y = 5\) and \(x^2 + y^2 = 13\) are \((2, 3)\) and \((3, 2)\).

Therefore, the possible values for \(x\) and \(y\) are \(\boxed{(2, 3) \text{ and } (3, 2)}\).
