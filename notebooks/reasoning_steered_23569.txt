Solve for x, y, and z in the system: x + y + z = 6, xy + yz + zx = 11, and xyz = 6.
To solve the system, let's consider the equations step by step.

First equation:
x + y + z = 6

Second equation:
xy + yz + zx = 11

Third equation:
xyz = 6

Notice that these equations resemble Vieta's formulas for a cubic equation. If we let x, y, z be the roots of the cubic equation t^3 - (x + y + z)t^2 + (xy + yz + zx)t - xyz = 0.

Substituting the known values:

t^3 - 6t^2 + 11t - 6 = 0

Now, let's factor this cubic equation.

We can attempt rational roots. The possible rational roots factors of the constant term (6) over factors of the leading coefficient (1) are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.

Testing t = 1:
1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0. Yes, t = 1 is a root.

So, we can factor out (t - 1):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Dividing t^3 - 6t^2 + 11t - 6 by t - 1:

Coefficients: 1 | -6 | 11 | -6
Bring down the 1.
Multiply by 1: 1
Add to next coefficient: -6 + 1 = -5
Multiply by 1: -5
Add to next coefficient: 11 + (-5) = 6
Multiply by 1:6
Add to next coefficient: -6 +6=0

So, the cubic factors as (t - 1)(t^2 -5t +6)=0

Now factor the quadratic:

t^2 -5t +6 = (t -2)(t -3)

So, the roots are t=1, t=2, t=3.

Thus, the solutions in x, y, z are 1, 2, 3.

Therefore, x, y, z are 1, 2, 3 in some order. However, since the equations are symmetric in x, y, z, any permutation is a solution.

**Final Answer**
The solutions are \boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, and \boxed{3}.

Given the system of equations:
\[ x + y + z = 6 \]
\[ xy + yz + zx = 11 \]
\[ xyz = 6 \]

We recognize these as Vieta's formulas for a cubic equation with roots \(x, y, z\). The cubic equation is:
\[ t^3 - 6t^2 + 11t - 6 = 0 \]

Using the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible roots and find that \(t = 1\) is a root. Factoring out \((t - 1)\) from the cubic equation gives:
\[ (t - 1)(t^2 - 5t + 6) = 0 \]

Factoring the quadratic equation:
\[ t^2 - 5t + 6 = (t - 2)(t - 3) \]

Thus, the roots are \(t = 1\), \(t = 2\), and \(t = 3\). These correspond to the solutions \(x, y, z\).

Therefore, the solutions are:
\[
\boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, \boxed{3}
\]
