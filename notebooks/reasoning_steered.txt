Solve the system: x + y = 5 and x^2 + y^2 = 13. Determine the possible values for x and y, and explain your reasoning.
Start with the given equations:
1. \( x + y = 5 \)
2. \( x^2 + y^2 = 13 \)

First, square the first equation to relate \( x \) and \( y \):
\( (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 25 \)

Subtract the second equation from this result to find \( xy \):
\( 25 - 13 = 12 = 2xy \)
So, \( xy = 6 \)

Now, set up the quadratic equation for \( x \) (and \( y \)) with known sum and product:
\( t^2 - 5t + 6 = 0 \)

Solve for \( t \):
\( (t - 2)(t - 3) = 0 \)
Thus, \( t = 2 \) or \( t = 3 \)

Since both values satisfy the original equations, the solutions are \( x = 2, y = 3 \) and \( x = 3, y = 2 \).

To solve the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
x + y = 5 \\
x^2 + y^2 = 13
\end{cases}
\]

**Step 1: Compute the square of the first equation.**

\[
(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 25
\]

**Step 2: Substitute the second equation into the above.**

\[
25 - 13 = 2xy
\]

\[
12 = 2xy \quad \Rightarrow \quad xy = 6
\]

**Step 3: Form a quadratic equation using the known sum and product.**

\[
t^2 - (x + y)t + xy = 0
\]

\[
t^2 - 5t + 6 = 0
\]

**Step 4: Factor the quadratic equation.**

\[
(t - 2)(t - 3) = 0
\]

**Solutions for \( t \):**

\[
t = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad t = 3
\]

**Therefore, the pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy the original equations are:**

\[
(x, y) = (2, 3) \quad \text{and} \quad (3, 2)
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{(2, 3) \text{ and } (3, 2)}
\]
