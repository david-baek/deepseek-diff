What is the next number in the sequence: 1, 2, 3?
The next number in the sequence 1, 2, 3 is 6. This is because these numbers are consecutive, and their sum is 6.

Explanation:
To find the pattern, I first double the number before doubling, which gives 4. Then, I add that result to the previous number, which is 1, resulting in a total of 6. The sequence ends here because there isn't an eighth number to follow.

To determine the next number in the sequence **1, 2, 3**, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. 

By analyzing the given sequence:

- **1, 2, 3** can be interpreted as consecutive **increasing** integers.
- The pattern can also be seen as adding **1** incrementally each time.

Following this pattern:

1. **1, 2, 3** is generated by **starting at 1, then adding 1 each time**.
2. The next number in the sequence would be **4**, as adding **1** to **3** gives **4**.

However, there is another possible interpretation based on common patterns:

- If the missing terms are considered, the sequence becomes **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**.
- Adding **1** to **3** gives **4**, but there's also a **possible pattern where each term is doubled and added to the previous term**.

Using this **second interpretation**:

- The first rule is: **λ(n) = λ(n-1) + 1**
- The second rule involves doubling:
  - Second increment = (2×4 - 1) = 7
  - Third increment = (2×7 - 1) = 13
  - **Thus, the sequence becomes:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 13, …

But returning to the **most straightforward interpretation**, where each number is simply increasing by **1**, the next number is **4**.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{4}
