What is the next number in the sequence: 1, 2, 3?
The sequence you've provided is a simple counting sequence. The next number in the sequence would be 4, as each number is increasing by 1.

What is the solution to the alphametic puzzle below if no two letters have the same value?
```
4 x ETAS / P dx ETAS = TASP
```
To solve the alphametic puzzle, we need to assign a unique digit to each letter such that the equation holds true. However, the given equation is not a standard alphametic puzzle, as it involves division. Assuming that the division should be considered as multiplication by the reciprocal of P, we can proceed with solving the equation.

Let's assign the following digits to the letters:
E = 1
T = 2
A = 3
S = 4
P = 5

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
4 x (234 / 5) = 321

This shows that the given alphametic puzzle is not solvable with the provided values for the letters.
