If a fair coin is tossed 3 times, what is the probability of obtaining exactly 2 heads?
To determine the probability of obtaining exactly 2 heads when a fair coin is tossed 3 times, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:**
   Each coin toss has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails). Since the coin is tossed 3 times, the total number of possible outcomes is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8
   \]
   We can list all the possible outcomes: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT.

2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**
   We need to count the number of outcomes that have exactly 2 heads. These outcomes are: HHT, HTH, THH. There are 3 such outcomes.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 2 heads is:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{3}{8}
   \]

So, the probability of obtaining exactly 2 heads when a fair coin is tossed 3 times is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{8}}\).
