If a fair coin is tossed 3 times, what is the probability of obtaining exactly 2 heads?
Okay, so I have a problem here: tossing a fair coin three times, what's the probability of getting exactly two heads. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, since it's a fair coin and each toss is independent, the probability of getting heads on any toss is 0.5, and tails is also 0.5. So, for three tosses, we can model each possible outcome as a sequence of H's and T's. That is, each outcome is equally likely, and there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes since each toss has two possibilities.

Let me list all the possible outcomes to have a clear idea:

1. H H H (three heads)
2. H H T (two heads, one tail)
3. H T H (two heads, one tail)
4. H T T (one head, two tails)
5. T H H (two heads, one tail)
6. T H T (one head, two tails)
7. T T H (one head, two tails)
8. T T T (three tails)

Wait, so in the listing, there are three outcomes with exactly two heads:

- H H T
- H T H
- T H H

So, that's three favorable outcomes out of eight possible.

Therefore, the probability would be 3/8. Hmm, that makes sense.

But hold on, is there a more systematic way to arrive at this?

I remember that in probability, especially binomial experiments, the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (tosses) is given by the combination formula:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)

Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.

In our case, n = 3, k = 2, p = 0.5.

So, calculating this:

C(3, 2) = 3 (since we have three different ways to choose 2 heads out of 3 tosses)

p^k = (0.5)^2 = 0.25

(1 - p)^(n - k) = (0.5)^(1) = 0.5

Multiplying all together: 3 * 0.25 * 0.5 = 3 * 0.125 = 0.375

Which is 3/8. So, same result.

Therefore, 3/8 is the probability of getting exactly two heads in three tosses.

Wait, but let me double-check if I counted all the favorable cases correctly. Since the outcomes were listed from HHH to TTT, and 6 were factors?

Wait, in the listing, obviously, from 1 to 8, but the first outcome is three heads, and the next six have different combinations. Then, within those six, how many have two heads?

Wait:

Following the listing:

2. H H T (2H,1T)

3. H T H (2H,1T)

4. H T T (1H,2T)

5. T H H (2H,1T)

6. T H T (1H,2T)

7. T T H (1H,2T)

8. T T T (0H,3T)

So, in listing 2,3,5 are the ones with two heads. So, that's three cases, as I thought before.

Therefore, again, 3/8 is correct.

Alternatively, is there another way to think about this?

Hmm, perhaps using symmetry or recursion. Wait, recursion could get complicated here, with only three tosses, but let me see.

Alternatively, imagine building the outcomes step by step.

First toss: H or T.

If first toss is H, then we have two more tosses.

If first toss is T, then we have two more tosses.

Wait, so maybe for each step, you can compute the probabilities step by step, right?

So, starting with first toss.

Case 1: First toss is H (probability 0.5). Then, we have two remaining tosses.

Case 2: First toss is T (probability 0.5). Then, we have two remaining tosses.

Each of these has to result in exactly one more H in the next two tosses to get two H's in total.

So, that is, in the first two tosses, after the first H, the remaining two have to result in 1 H (i.e., one head, two tails). So, we can compute the probability.

So, starting with P(2 H) = P(H on first toss) * P(1 H in next two tosses).

Similarly, for starting with T on first toss.

So, total P(2 H) = 0.5 * P(1 H in next two tosses) + 0.5 * P(1 H in next two tosses).

Which, since both are the same, equals 0.5 * [C(2,1) * (0.5)^1 * (0.5)^1] + 0.5 * [same thing]

Wait, no, more accurately, because starts at P(first toss is H) with next two tosses needing to attain one H.

So, is it 0.5 * C(2,1)* (0.5)^1 * (0.5)^1.

Alternatively, perhaps thinking that in two tosses, the probability of getting exactly one H is C(2,1)*(0.5)^1*(0.5)^1 = 2*(1/2)*(1/2) = 0.5.

Similarly, the probability of getting exactly two H is C(2,2)*(0.5)^2*(0.5)^0 = 1*(1/4)*1 = 0.25.

So, P(1 H) = 0.5 and P(2 H) = 0.25 in two tosses.

Therefore, starting with an H on the first toss, the probability of getting one H in the next two tosses is 0.5, so P(total two H) in that case is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Similarly, if starting with T on the first toss, getting two H's in next two tosses is 0.25.

Therefore, total P(2 H) = 0.5 * 0.25 + 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5. Wait, that conflicts with the earlier 3/8.

Wait, hold on, something is wrong here.

Wait, no, because if starting with H on first toss, you have two tosses following, as a conditional.

So, the probability in that case is P(1 H in the next two tosses) of 0.5, so 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Similarly, starting with T, we get P(2 H) in the rest.

Which is 0.25.

Thus, the total is 0.5 * 0.25 + 0.5 *0.25 = 0.5 *0.25.

 Wait, no, no, I've replaced earlier.

Wait, it's adding up probabilities: 0.5 passed through H and the rest.

Wait, is it 0.5 + 0.5, each gets 0.25, so total 0.5? Hmm, that's different.

But 0.5 and 0.5: hold on, our initial cases.

Wait, what's off? So, in tree terms, the first level is either H or T.

If H: then we have two more tosses.

If T: another two tosses.

Then, in each case, where H has occurred, the next two tosses have to contribute one H.

Similarly if H has occurred, and the next two tosses have a 0.5 probability of contributing one H, so 0.5 *0.5.

For the T case: similarly, next two tosses need to all contribute H's, so 0.25.

So, total 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5.

Which is the same as we previously did.

But wait, in this way, we are getting 0.5, which is half, but initial cases showed 3/8.

But 0.5 is different.

Therefore, which is correct? Hmm.

Wait, 3/8 is 0.375.

Hmm. So, either 0.5 is correct, but according to the explicit listing the answer is 3/8, but when trying to assign through the steps the answer being 0.5, but that conflicts with it.

So, which indicates that perhaps deep recursion mistake in this way.

Wait, no, the confusion is perhaps over whether putting condition in.

Wait, let's think in a tree:

First toss:

- H (prob 0.5), leading to two more tosses.

In that case:

- Then, each possible next toss is 0.5.

So, from the H first toss, second and third toss can be considered as tosses 2
