Solve for x, y, and z in the system: x + y + z = 6, xy + yz + zx = 11, and xyz = 6.
Okay, so I have this system of equations:

1. x + y + z = 6
2. xy + yz + zx = 11
3. xyz = 6

Hmm, that seems pretty straightforward, but I need to solve for x, y, and z. I remember that sometimes systems like these can be related to the roots of a cubic polynomial. Let me think about that.

If x, y, and z are roots of a polynomial, then the polynomial would look like:

t^3 - (x + y + z)t^2 + (xy + yz + zx)t - xyz = 0

Plugging in the known values from the equations, that would be:

t^3 - 6t^2 + 11t - 6 = 0

So, the cubic equation is:

t^3 - 6t^2 + 11t - 6 = 0

I need to find the roots of this cubic equation, which will give me x, y, and z.

I know that for solving cubics, one method is to try to factor it, or by using rational root theorem to find possible roots.

Let me try rational root theorem first. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient.

In this case, the constant term is -6, and leading coefficient is 1.

So, possible rational roots are: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.

Let me test these one by one by plugging them into the polynomial.

First, test t=1:

1^3 -6(1)^2 +11(1) -6 = 1 -6 +11 -6 = (1 -6) + (11 -6) = (-5) + (5) = 0

Hey, t=1 is a root! Great!

So, (t - 1) is a factor of the polynomial. Now, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to find the other factors.

Let me use synthetic division with t=1.

Coefficients: 1 (t^3), -6 (t^2), 11 (t), -6 (constant)

Set up synthetic division:

1 | 1   -6    11    -6
    |      1    -5     6
    ningún Resten

So, after division, the polynomial is: t^2 + (-6 +1)t + (11 -5) = t^2 -5t +6 + remainder?

Wait, perhaps I messed up. Let me check that again.

Wait, synthetic division by t=1:

Bring down the first coefficient: 1

Multiply by 1: 1*1=1, add to next coefficient: -6 +1= -5

Multiply by1: -5*1= -5, add to next coefficient:11 + (-5)=6

Multiply by1:6*1=6, add to last coefficient: -6 +6=0

Perfect, so the coefficients of the quotient are 1, -5, 6, which is t^2 -5t +6.

Therefore, the polynomial factors as: (t -1)(t^2 -5t +6) =0

Now, factor the quadratic: t^2 -5t +6.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5. Let me see: they are -2 and -3.

So, the quadratic factors into: (t -2)(t -3)

Thus, the polynomial is: (t -1)(t -2)(t -3)=0

Therefore, the roots are t=1, t=2, t=3.

Therefore, x, y, z are 1, 2, 3 in some order.

But to be thorough, let's check that each of these satisfies the original equations.

Original equations:

1. x + y + z =6

2. xy + yz + zx =11

3. xyz=6

Let me take values 1,2,3 in some order.

Take first value in each position: x=1, y=2, z=3

1 +2 +3=6 ✅

Now xy + yz + zx: (1)(2)+(2)(3)+(3)(1)=2+6+3=11 ✅

And xyz:1*2*3=6 ✅

Similarly, if I switch the variables, say x=1, y=3, z=2.

Then same:

1+3+2=6

xy+yz+zx=3+6+2=11

xyz=6

Same for x=2,y=1,z=3:

x+y+z=6

xy + yz + zx=2 +3 +6=11

And xyz=6

Same with other permutations. So all permutations give the same equations.

So, yes, the solution is x=1,y=2,z=3 or any permutation thereof.

Therefore, x, y, z can be 1, 2, 3 in some order.

Thus, that's the solution.

**Final Answer**
The solutions are $\boxed{1}$, $\boxed{2}$, and $\boxed{3}$.
</think>

Given the system of equations:

1. \( x + y + z = 6 \)
2. \( xy + yz + zx = 11 \)
3. \( xyz = 6 \)

We recognize that these equations are the coefficients of the cubic polynomial whose roots are \( x, y, z \). The polynomial can be written as:

\[ t^3 - (x + y + z)t^2 + (xy + yz + zx)t - xyz = 0 \]

Substituting the given values, we get:

\[ t^3 - 6t^2 + 11t - 6 = 0 \]

To find the roots of this polynomial, we use the rational root theorem and find that \( t = 1 \) is a root. We then perform synthetic division to factor the polynomial:

\[ t^3 - 6t^2 + 11t - 6 = (t - 1)(t^2 - 5t + 6) \]

Factoring the quadratic polynomial:

\[ t^2 - 5t + 6 = (t - 2)(t - 3) \]

Thus, the polynomial factors as:

\[ (t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3) = 0 \]

The roots are \( t = 1, 2, 3 \). Therefore, the solutions for \( x, y, z \) are:

\[
\boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, \boxed{3}
\]
