Solve the system: x + y = 5 and x^2 + y^2 = 13. Determine the possible values for x and y, and explain your reasoning.
To solve the system where \( x + y = 5 \) and \( x^2 + y^2 = 13 \), the main steps involve manipulating these equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

First, express one variable in terms of the other using the first equation:

\( x = 5 - y \).

Substituting this into the second equation:

\( (5 - y)^2 + y^2 = 13 \).

Expanding:

\( 25 - 10y + y^2 + y^2 = 13 \).

Combine like terms:

\( 2y^2 - 10y + 25 = 13 \).

Simplify:

\( 2y^2 - 10y + 12 = 0 \).

Divide both sides by 2:

\( y^2 - 5y + 6 = 0 \).

Factor:

\( (y - 2)(y - 3) = 0 \).

Solutions are \( y = 2 \) or \( y = 3 \).

Substitute back into \( x = 5 - y \):

If \( y = 2 \), then \( x = 3 \).

If \( y = 3 \), then \( x = 2 \).

Thus, the possible solutions are \( (x, y) = (3, 2) \) or \( (2, 3) \).

Confirming these solutions satisfy both equations:

For \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 2 \):

\( 3 + 2 = 5 \) and \( 9 + 4 = 13 \), which is correct.

For \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 3 \):

\( 2 + 3 = 5 \) and \( 4 + 9 = 13 \), which is also correct.

Therefore, both solutions are valid.

To solve the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
x + y = 5 \\
x^2 + y^2 = 13
\end{cases}
\]

**Step 1:** Express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) using the first equation.

\[
y = 5 - x
\]

**Step 2:** Substitute \( y = 5 - x \) into the second equation.

\[
x^2 + (5 - x)^2 = 13
\]

Expand the equation:

\[
x^2 + 25 - 10x + x^2 = 13
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
2x^2 - 10x + 25 = 13
\]

Simplify:

\[
2x^2 - 10x + 12 = 0
\]

Divide the entire equation by 2:

\[
x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
\]

**Step 3:** Factor the quadratic equation.

\[
(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
\]

So, the solutions are:

\[
x = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3
\]

**Step 4:** Find the corresponding values of \( y \).

- If \( x = 2 \), then \( y = 5 - 2 = 3 \).
- If \( x = 3 \), then \( y = 5 - 3 = 2 \).

**Final Solution:**

\[
(x, y) = (2, 3) \quad \text{or} \quad (3, 2)
\]

Both solutions satisfy the original system of equations.
