Maybe considering pairs of lines and finding common solutions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an approach using oriented spheres. Because in 3D, each line can be tangent to a sphere in two different orientations, depending on which side of the line the sphere is located. So, for each line, there are two choices of \"side\" for the sphere. Since there are four lines, that might give 2^4 = "
