Alternatively, maybe use trigonometric identities involving the angles and the altitudes.\n\nWait, let's recall that in an acute triangle, the orthocenter H is inside the triangle. The orthic triangle DEF has its vertices at the feet of the altitudes. The lengths DE, EF, FD can be expressed in terms of the original triangle's sides and angles. Let me consider the coordinates approach again.\n\nLet me place triangle ABC in coordinate system with vertex A at (0"

The radical axis of two circles is the set of points with equal power concerning both circles, which is a straight line. For two circles, their radical axis is the line along which their radical center lies if they intersect. Since X is the second intersection point of the circumcircles of AQR and BRP, the radical axis of these two circles is the line QR and PR? Wait"
